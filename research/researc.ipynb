The tectonic movement, gravity, and erosive forces shaped the mountain peak feature on the Earth\\'s surface (Brondon & Printer, 2005). It is a gradual transition process from plain to mountain terrain.  Mountain peak regions consist of rugged terrain, a low-temperature climate regime, steep slopes, and remoteness. Kapos has used (as cited by Vivirol, Du¨rr, Messerli, Meybeck, & Weingartner, 2007) criteria based on altitude and slope in combination to represent the world’s mountain environments. Kapos Goudie (1985) de ﬁnes mountains as ‘‘substantial \\nelevations of the Earth’s crust above sea level resulting in localized disruptions to climate, drainage, soils, plants and animals (Vivirol, Du¨rr, Messerli, Meybeck, & Weingartner, 2007). The word \\'Himalaya\\' is derived from two Sanskrit words,- \"Hi-ma\\' snow, and \"a-la-ya,\" abode; and it means abode of snow. The Himalayan range is in the south and east of Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan plateau, which is 2400 km long and 200 to 300 km wide (Yang & Zheng, 2004). According to geographical location, the Nepal Himalaya lies on the Eastern Himalaya (WWF, 2021) of the Asian continent, Sher Bahadur Gurung\\nCentral Department of Geography, Tribhuvan University\\nCorrespondence: sherbahadur@gmail.comMountain Peaks of Nepal Himalaya'),\n",

Apollo (2017) classi ﬁed the Nepal \\nHimalaya as central Himalaya based on the longitudinal division of Himalayas. Similarly, based on climate-ecology and phytogeographical division, the Nepal Himalaya lies on the eastern part of the Kumaun Himalaya (Kumaun to Kali Gandaki) and the western part of eastern Himalaya (Kaligandaki to Satlaj River) (Gurung, 2004). \\nNepal is a mountainous country with numerous peaks and pinnacles. Its surface con ﬁguration \\nconsists mainly of mountains, hills, plateaus, basins, valleys, and plain/Terai of varying altitude and magnitude. It is home to the world's highest peak, Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) 8848.86 m asl (MoCTCA, 2020), as well as a number of 8000 meters exceeding snow-capped mountains. Other  highest eight-thousanders also lie within Nepal's territory: Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho-Oyu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu and Annapurna exist in Nepal. These mountains are often called nature's water towers so that these are sources of freshwater. About half of all humankind directly depends on mountain resources, primarily water (Sharma,  Molden, Rahman, Khatiwada, Zhang, Singh, Yao, & Wester, 2019). \\nThe Nepal Himalaya is home to 26.5 million people (CBS, 2014), and it serves the downstream \\nlarge population of the world because the ecosystem of the region depends on the Himalaya system. Its scenic beauty and adventurous attractions magnetize the world's tourists and mountaineers/ mountain enthusiasts (Howard, 2016). According to Pomfret and Hales (cited by Musa, James, & Anna, 2015), mountaineering is mountain-based adventure tourism. It has gained immense worldwide popularity. The high water towers (Himalayan water reserves) attract many people for cultural reasons as well. Mountaineers devotedly offer prayers and prayer ﬂags at the top. According to Buddhism and Hinduism, the mountains are \\nconsidered sacred places of the divine presence.\\nIn 1590, Antonio Monserrate accurately sketched the Himalaya ranges, and in 1733 a French \\ngeographer, Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d’Arville, compiled the ﬁrst map of Tibet and the \\nHimalayan range based on systematic exploration (Britanica, 2021). In the mid 19th century, Nepal and Indian mountains were measured by the systematic trigonometric survey, and during this time, the highest peak of the world was named Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) after Sir George Everest in 1865. In Nepal, the ﬁrst efforts were carried out to mapping peaks in the \\nNepal Himalaya in 1994 (Gurung, 1994) based on available topographic maps. Central Department of Geography (CDG) of TU prepared an inventory of mountain peaks of Nepal Himalaya in support of Nepal Tourism Board (CDG, 2002) and Survey Department, Government of Nepal, publishing spot heights including Himalaya peaks of Nepal (DOS, 1998). The total number of Himalayan peaks varies with different studies. So, the present study explores the peaks of the Nepal Himalaya as open spots for mountaineering.\\nMethod and materials\\nThe distribution of the Himalayan peaks of Nepal is presented based on secondary data. The heights of Nepal Himalaya are derived from 'Nepal Himalaya Inventory' (Gurung, 1994), 'Inventory of Nepal Himalaya' (CDG, 2002), and spot height shape ﬁle (DOS, 1998). The \\nstudy of Gurung is based on Indian topo-sheet and the scale is 1:50000. The study of CDG is  based on a topo-sheet of the eastern part to the Annapurna range. Rest of the database is based on an Indian topo sheet, boundary map between Nepal and China. The spot height is based on a 1:50000 map scale.

Extreme heat from lava and magma inside the Earth ﬂowed in and out of the \\nearth, causing continental reclamation. In the course of continuous ﬂow, the Asian and Indian \\nplates collided with each other (the Tethys Sea between the Asian and Indian plates, (See Fig 1) and the Himalayas ﬁrst raised about 650 million years ago, the Mahabharata (mountainous \\nterrain) and the Chure mountains about 600 and 250 million years ago respectively. The movement of continental plates of the Earth's surface follows the thermodynamic principle. This sequence is still continuous, and thus the present Himal, Mid Hill, Mahabharat, and Chure originated (See Fig 2).\\nThe mountains and hills of Nepal occupy 77 percent, and single high mountains occupy 25 \\npercent (Gurung, 2004).\\nFigure 1:  Tectonic plate   \\nSource: After USGS, 1999    \\nFigure 2:  Himalaya ranges\\nSource: Google earth, 2020\\n\"),\n",

Amadablam (6812M) 8000 80008 <=6500 4000 2000\\nSource: DOT, 2020\\nDiscussion\\nTraditionally trigonometric land survey was an effective tool for measuring and mapping \\nheight of mountains (Punmiya, 1995). Before that, travelers used to sketch the mountain ranges pretty accurately. Sir George Everest scienti ﬁcally measured the Himalayan peaks, \\nincluding Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest), the highest peak (8848.86 m) of the world, from 1830 to 1843 (Smith, 1999), and in 1961, this region was mapped by the Royal Geographical Society (Ward, 2013) based on stereo photogrammetric expeditions. Gurung (1994), DOS (1998) and CDG (2002) mapped Himalayan peaks of Nepal based on the aerial photo using the stereo-photogrammetric method. Gurung (1994) listed out Himalaya peaks based on topographic maps (Nepal west sheet 1967 and Nepal east sheet 1969) by the UK Ministry of Defense and Sino Nepal border Map 1962. DOS (1998) worked on a topo map of Nepal with spot heights, including Himalaya peaks and place heights. CDG (2002) mapped Nepal Himalaya peaks based on a topographic map published by DOS for the eastern part of Nepal and rest of the peaks were done using the Sino-Nepal Border Map 1962. \\nThe table shows the list of peaks opened for mountaineering. Out of the total peaks greater or \\nequal to 8000 meters asl, 14 (88 percent) peaks are opened for mountaineering. Similarly, the peaks range from 7501 m to 7999 m, 7000 m to 7500 m, 6501 m to 6999 m, and 6000 m to 6500 m are open 70, 59, 58, and 17 percent respectively. There are the highest peaks opened for mountaineering in highest percent.'),\n",

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is also a recent advanced space technology for mapping Himalayas and mountains. Recently, the Department of Survey, Government of Nepal, measured Sagarmatha’s height using GNSS (DOS, 2020). DEM and GNSS techniques will be the supportive tools for detecting Himalaya peaks and terrains in detail.\\nConclusion\\nNepal is a mountainous country with numerous peaks and pinnacles. There are different facts and ﬁgures about the number of Himalayan peaks with height and name. Although there is an \\ninverse relationship between the number and height of peaks, the Department of Survey has digitized more peaks and pinnacles but needs more detailed work to separate peaks and spot heights. The Nepal Himalaya peaks opened for mountaineering are concentrated in the eastern part of the country. This study concludes that the needed amount of detailed study lacks appropriately due to the shortage of technical expertise and sources. So, detailed research activities are requuired to explore unidenti ﬁed and unnamed mountains and potential \\nmountaineering using DEM and GNSS space technology. These methods also support exploring physical characteristics of Himalaya like rock type, slope, aspect, slope and height which help to ﬁnd alternative routes to promote mountaineering in all seasons and all parts of \\nthe Nepal Himalaya and develop mountaineering sustainably. It also supports the determined scienti ﬁc mountaineering royalty based on mountaineering techniques.  \\n•\\nReferences\\nCBS (2014). Population Projection 2011 – 2031.
